<p>Updated: <strong>4/10/2022, 12:11:43 PM</strong></p>
<p>This is the privacy policy for the <em><strong>Aplication_Name</strong></em> application that runs on iOS mobile devices.</p>
<p>The app and this policy were created by <em>author_mame</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect?</h2>
<h3 id="what-information-does-the-aplication_name-application-obtain-and-how-is-it-used">What information does the <em>Aplication_Name</em> Application obtain and how is it used?</h3>
<p><em><em>Aplication_Name</em></em> does not collect any information from the user. However, the iOS platform on which the application
is built <em>may</em> collect information about your usage of the app. Please see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">the Apple Privacy
Policy</a> for specifics. I may receive Apple app usage metrics,
including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user running the <em><em>Aplication_Name</em></em> application.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-aplication_name-app-collect-real-time-location-information-of-the-device">Does the <em>Aplication_Name</em> app collect real-time location information of the device?</h3>
<p>No. The <em><em>Aplication_Name</em></em> app does not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the location of your mobile
device.</p>
<h3 id="do-third-parties-see-andor-have-access-to-information-obtained-by-aplication_name">Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by <em>Aplication_Name</em>?</h3>
<p>No. Simply put, <em><strong>Aplication_Name</strong></em> cannot share what it does not collect.</p>
