# <%= app.name %> Privacy Policy

Updated: __<%= date %>__

This is the privacy policy for the __<%= app.name %>__ application that runs on iOS mobile devices.

The app and this policy were created by <%= package.author.name %>.

## What information do we collect?

### What information does the <%= app.name %> Application obtain and how is it used?

*<%= app.name %>* does not collect any information from the user. However, the iOS platform on which the application
is built *may* collect information about your usage of the app. Please see [the Apple Privacy
Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) for specifics. I may receive Apple app usage metrics,
including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user running the *<%= app.name %>* application.

### Does the <%= app.name %> app collect real-time location information of the device?

No. The *<%= app.name %>* app does not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the location of your mobile
device.

### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by <%= app.name %>?

No. Simply put, __<%= app.name %>__ cannot share what it does not collect.

collected.
