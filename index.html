<p>Updated: <strong>4/10/2022, 1:51:26 PM</strong></p>
<p>This is the privacy policy for the <strong>OSCS</strong> application that runs on iOS mobile devices.</p>
<p>The app and this policy were created by Thierry Charbonnel.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect?</h2>
<h3 id="what-information-does-the-oscs-application-obtain-and-how-is-it-used">What information does the OSCS Application obtain and how is it used?</h3>
<p><em>OSCS</em> does not collect any information from the user. However, the iOS platform on which the application
is built <em>may</em> collect information about your usage of the app. Please see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/">the Apple Privacy
Policy</a> for specifics. I may receive Apple app usage metrics,
including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user running the <em>OSCS</em> application.</p>
<h3 id="does-the-oscs-app-collect-real-time-location-information-of-the-device">Does the OSCS app collect real-time location information of the device?</h3>
<p>No. The <em>OSCS</em> app does not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the location of your mobile
device.</p>
<h3 id="do-third-parties-see-andor-have-access-to-information-obtained-by-oscs">Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by OSCS?</h3>
<p>No. Simply put, <strong>OSCS</strong> cannot share what it does not collect.</p>
<h2 id="links-to-other-sites">Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
Some of these external sites are not operated by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes.
These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
<h2 id="data-retention-policy-managing-your-information">Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
<p>As there is no collection of data, there is likewise no retention, and thus no means to manage what is not being
collected.</p>
